# ðŸŽ“ C-Student-Info

This is my **second C project** â€” a program that collects and displays student details using `scanf` and `printf`.

## âœ¨ Features
- Takes user input:
  - College name
  - Branch
  - Roll number
  - Section
  - Percentage
- Displays the details in a clean format.

## ðŸ“– What I Learned
- Using `scanf` for different data types (`%s`, `%d`, `%c`, `%f`)
- Handling string input in C
- Formatting output with `printf`

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Save the code as `student_info.c`
2. Compile using:
   ```bash
   gcc student_info.c -o student_info
3.Run the program:
```bash
./student_info
```
